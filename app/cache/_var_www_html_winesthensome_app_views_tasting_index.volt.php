    <h3>Tasting Wines</h3>
    
    <h4>Wines tasting is very subjective because of the individual's taste will ultimately decide if this is a good wine.</h4>
    <p>Here are a few pointers designed to making the tasting an enjoyable experience</p>
    <ul>
    
    <li><div class="col-md-6"><p>1. Make sure to clean your palette between tastings - crackers,
    			cheeses are good to remove the taste of the last tasting so you are not mixing 
    			different taste together.</p>

          </li>
          
      <li>
      <div class="col-md-6" style="padding:20px;">
      <p >2. Swirl the glass to aerate the wine introducing oxygen to 
			the wine.  This action opens up the smells and flavors you'll 
			experience.  Place your nose right under that rim of the glass 
			and take a deep inhale through your nose.</p>

           <p>3. Swirl the glass to aerate the wine introducing oxygen to 
           the wine.  Take a small sip while bringing air into your mouth.  
           The more air the more flavores you'll experience.</p>
